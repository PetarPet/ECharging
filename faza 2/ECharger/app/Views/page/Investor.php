                            <p text-justify>
                                Serbia has humongous potential for investment because the economy and market are still behind EU. Infrastructure investments kick off a few years ago.<br/>
                                Major users of charging stations in Serbia are commuters from Western Europe.<br/>
                                Many investors have lack of faith to invest because of the uncertainty of return on investment. Their infrastructure is not or barely used because of the user's ignorance of infrastructure's existence. <br/><br/>
                                <i>Do you  have electric charger and have trouble finding customers in Serbia?</i> <br/>
                                <strong>Now that's history with our newest application.</strong> <br/> <br/>
                                All you need to do is to:
                                <strong>
                                <ol id="customer">
                                    <li><a href="<?php echo site_url('Home/investorSignUp')?>">Sign up</a></li>
                                    <li>Add your charger to our application and </li> 
                                    <li>Make profit. </li>
                                </ol>
                                </strong>
                                Making your chargers visible to foreign and also domestic users, you'll be able to focus on developing new infrastructure instead of trying to market existing.
